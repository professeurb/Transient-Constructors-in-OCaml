# Transient Constructors in OCaml

This repository explores the notion of _transient_ and _terminal_ constructors in OCaml. The aim is to define rigourous and generic ways to implement datatypes which support some form of _rebuilding_.

This notion is central in the definition of efficient persistent data structure, as studied in particular in Chris Okasaki's book "[Purely Functional Data Structures](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/algorithmics-complexity-computer-algebra-and-computational-g/purely-functional-data-structures)".
